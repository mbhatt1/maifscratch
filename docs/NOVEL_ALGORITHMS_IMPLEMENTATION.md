# MAIF Novel Algorithms Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the three novel algorithms and cross-modal AI capabilities in MAIF, replacing the removed advanced features.

## Removed Features

The following advanced features have been successfully removed from the MAIF documentation and codebase:

### Advanced Features Removed:
- **Homomorphic encryption**: Removed from future roadmap and references
- **Quantum-resistant crypto**: Removed from planned features

### Blockchain Integration Removed:
- **Immutable distributed audit trails**: Replaced with cryptographically-secured audit trails
- **Blockchain-anchored provenance**: Replaced with cryptographic hash chains and digital signatures
- All blockchain references updated to use cryptographic verification instead

## Implemented Novel Algorithms
