## Quick Start Reference

### Essential Imports

This snippet shows the most common imports for interacting with MAIF, from the high-level SDK to the low-level core components and novel algorithms.

```python
# The high-level SDK is the recommended entry point for most users.
from maif_sdk import (
    create_client,          # Factory function to create a MAIFClient instance.
    create_artifact,        # Factory function to create a new Artifact.
    load_artifact,          # Function to load an existing Artifact from a file.
    quick_write,            # A convenient one-line function for simple write operations.
    quick_read              # A convenient one-line function for simple read operations.
)

# For advanced use cases, you can import the core components directly.
from maif import (
    MAIFEncoder,            # The low-level engine for encoding data into the MAIF binary format.
    MAIFDecoder,            # The low-level engine for decoding data from the MAIF binary format.
    PrivacyEngine,          # The engine for managing encryption, anonymization, and other privacy features.
    SecurityEngine,         # The engine for managing digital signatures, access control, and auditing.
    SemanticEmbedder        # The component responsible for generating semantic embeddings.
)

# For cutting-edge AI applications, you can directly use MAIF's novel algorithms.
from maif.semantic_optimized import (
    AdaptiveCrossModalAttention,      # The ACAM algorithm for multi-modal understanding.
    HierarchicalSemanticCompression,  # The HSC algorithm for semantic-aware compression.
    CryptographicSemanticBinding      # The CSB algorithm for binding semantics to cryptography.
)
```

### Basic Usage Pattern

This example demonstrates the fundamental workflow of using MAIF: create a client and artifact, add content, save, and then load and search.

```python
# 1. Initialize the client and create a new artifact for the agent's memory.
client = create_client("my-agent")
artifact = create_artifact("agent-memory", client)

# 2. Add content to the artifact with built-in features enabled.
text_id = artifact.add_text(
    "Important data",
    encrypt=True,                    # Encrypt the data at rest.
    anonymize=True,                  # Automatically detect and redact PII.
    compress=True                    # Compress the data to save space.
)

# 3. Save the artifact to a file with a cryptographic signature to ensure integrity.
artifact.save("memory.maif", sign=True)

# 4. Load the artifact and perform a semantic search.
loaded = load_artifact("memory.maif")
results = loaded.search("query", top_k=5)
```

The `MAIFClient` is highly configurable. This example shows some of the most common options for tuning performance, security, and other features.

```python
from maif_sdk import create_client
from maif import SecurityLevel, CompressionLevel

client = create_client(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    
    # --- Performance Tuning ---
    enable_mmap=True,                    # Use memory-mapped I/O for faster file access.
    buffer_size=128*1024,                # Set the size of the write buffer (in bytes).
    max_concurrent_writers=8,            # Allow up to 8 parallel write operations.
    
    # --- Security Configuration ---
    default_security_level=SecurityLevel.CONFIDENTIAL, # Set the default security level for all operations.
    enable_signing=True,                 # Automatically add a digital signature when saving artifacts.
    key_derivation_rounds=100000,        # Use 100,000 rounds for PBKDF2 key derivation.
    
    # --- Privacy Configuration ---
    enable_privacy=True,                 # Enable the privacy engine.
    default_encryption=True,             # Encrypt all new data blocks by default.
    anonymization_patterns=["ssn", "email", "phone"], # Define custom patterns for PII detection.
    
    # --- Semantic Configuration ---
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Specify the default model for generating embeddings.
    enable_semantic_search=True,         # Automatically index new data for semantic search.
    semantic_threshold=0.75,             # Set the default similarity threshold for search results.
    
    # --- Compression Configuration ---
    default_compression=CompressionLevel.BALANCED, # Set the default compression level.
    semantic_compression=True,           # Use the novel HSC algorithm for semantic-aware compression.
    compression_threshold=1024           # Only compress data blocks larger than 1 KB.
)
```

### Privacy Policies

MAIF provides predefined privacy policies and allows you to create custom policies to meet specific compliance requirements.

```python
from maif import PrivacyPolicy, PrivacyLevel, EncryptionMode

# Use one of the predefined policies for common use cases.
public_policy = PrivacyPolicy.PUBLIC
internal_policy = PrivacyPolicy.INTERNAL
confidential_policy = PrivacyPolicy.CONFIDENTIAL
restricted_policy = PrivacyPolicy.RESTRICTED

# Or, create a custom policy with specific rules.
custom_policy = PrivacyPolicy(
    privacy_level=PrivacyLevel.CONFIDENTIAL,          # Set the privacy level.
    encryption_mode=EncryptionMode.CHACHA20_POLY1305, # Specify a strong encryption cipher.
    anonymization_required=True,                      # Require that data be anonymized.
    differential_privacy=True,                        # Apply differential privacy techniques.
    audit_required=True,                              # Ensure all operations on data with this policy are audited.
    retention_days=365                                # Set a data retention period of 365 days.
)
```

### Error Handling

MAIF has a rich set of custom exceptions that allow you to handle specific errors gracefully.

```python
from maif.exceptions import (
    MAIFError,                    # The base exception for all MAIF errors.
    PrivacyViolationError,        # Raised when a privacy policy is violated.
    SecurityError,                # Raised on security failures, such as invalid signatures.
    CompressionError,             # Raised on failures during compression or decompression.
    SemanticError,                # Raised on errors during semantic processing.
    IntegrityError                # Raised when data integrity checks fail.
)

try:
    # Attempt a potentially problematic operation.
    artifact.add_text("sensitive data", encrypt=True)
except PrivacyViolationError as e:
    # Handle a specific privacy violation.
    logger.error(f"Privacy violation: {e}")
except SecurityError as e:
    # Handle a specific security error.
    logger.error(f"Security error: {e}")
except MAIFError as e:
    # Handle any other MAIF-related error.
    logger.error(f"General MAIF error: {e}")
```

## Performance Guidelines

### Memory Management

```python
# Efficient memory usage
with client.open_artifact("large-file.maif") as artifact:
    # Streaming processing
    for batch in artifact.stream_blocks(batch_size=1000):
        process_batch(batch)
    
    # Memory-mapped access
    data = artifact.get_block_data("block-id", mmap=True)
    
    # Lazy loading
    results = artifact.search("query", lazy_load=True)
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# Batch writing for performance
with client.batch_writer("output.maif") as writer:
    for item in large_dataset:
        writer.add_text(item.text, metadata=item.metadata)
        
        # Periodic flush
        if writer.batch_size > 1000:
            writer.flush()

# Batch reading
artifacts = client.load_artifacts_batch([
    "file1.maif", "file2.maif", "file3.maif"
], parallel=True)
```

### Caching Strategies

```python
# Enable caching for repeated operations
client.configure_cache(
    embedding_cache_size=10000,     # Cache embeddings
    block_cache_size=1000,          # Cache blocks
    search_cache_size=500,          # Cache search results
    cache_ttl=3600                  # 1 hour TTL
)

# Preload frequently accessed data
artifact.preload_blocks(["block1", "block2", "block3"])
artifact.build_search_index()  # Pre-build search index
```

## Type System

MAIF uses Python type hints extensively for better IDE support and runtime validation:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union, Iterator
from maif.types import (
    BlockID,              # Type alias for block identifiers
    ContentType,          # Enum for content types
    SecurityLevel,        # Enum for security levels
    PrivacyLevel,         # Enum for privacy levels
    CompressionLevel,     # Enum for compression levels
    SearchResult,         # Type for search results
    AuditEntry,          # Type for audit log entries
    EmbeddingVector      # Type for embedding vectors
)

# Type-annotated function example
def process_artifact(
    artifact: Artifact,
    query: str,
    filters: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    top_k: int = 10
) -> List[SearchResult]:
    """Type-safe artifact processing."""
    return artifact.search(query, filters=filters, top_k=top_k)
```
