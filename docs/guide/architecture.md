```

## Component Architecture

### 1. SDK Layer

The SDK provides high-level abstractions for AI developers, simplifying interaction with the MAIF core. This example shows the most common entry point for an application.

```python
# The SDK provides simple, high-level functions for common tasks.
from maif_sdk import create_client, create_artifact

# `create_client` initializes the connection to the MAIF core and sets up configurations.
client = create_client("my-agent")
# `create_artifact` gives you a handle to a secure, persistent data container.
artifact = create_artifact("memory", client)
```

**Components:**
- **MAIFClient**: Connection management and configuration
- **Artifact**: Data container with built-in features
- **Quick Functions**: One-line operations for common tasks

### 2. Core Engine

The core engine handles low-level operations and orchestrates all subsystems:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Core Engine Components"
        Orchestrator[Engine Orchestrator]
        BlockManager[Block Manager]
        MetadataManager[Metadata Manager]
        TransactionManager[Transaction Manager]

        BlockManager --> B4[Data Blocks]
        
        MetadataManager --> M1[Timestamps]
        MetadataManager --> M2[Provenance]
        MetadataManager --> M3[Relationships]
        
        TransactionManager --> T1[ACID Properties]
        TransactionManager --> T2[Rollback]
        TransactionManager --> T3[Consistency]
    end
    
    style Orchestrator fill:#3c82f6,stroke:#1e40af,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style TransactionManager fill:#10b981,stroke:#059669,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

### 3. Specialized Engines

Each engine handles specific aspects of data processing. These engines are highly configurable to meet the demands of different use cases.

#### Privacy Engine

The Privacy Engine is responsible for all cryptographic and privacy-preserving operations. This example shows how to configure it with specific algorithms and parameters.

```python
from maif import PrivacyEngine

# Initialize the Privacy Engine with specific configurations.
privacy = PrivacyEngine(
    # Set the encryption algorithm. AES-GCM is a high-performance, authenticated encryption standard.
    encryption_algorithm="AES-GCM",
    # Increase the number of rounds for key derivation to enhance security against brute-force attacks.
    key_derivation_rounds=100000,
    # Set the epsilon value for differential privacy to control the trade-off between privacy and utility.
    differential_privacy_epsilon=1.0
)
```

#### Security Engine

The Security Engine manages digital signatures, access control, and auditing. This example shows how to configure it for a typical enterprise environment.

```python
from maif import SecurityEngine

# Initialize the Security Engine with specific security policies.
security = SecurityEngine(
    # Set the digital signature algorithm. Ed25519 is a fast and secure signature scheme.
    signature_algorithm="Ed25519",
    # Specify the access control model. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a common choice.
    access_control="RBAC",
    # Set the audit level to "DETAILED" to record all operations for compliance and forensics.
    audit_level="DETAILED"
)
```

#### Semantic Engine

The Semantic Engine handles everything related to semantic understanding, from embeddings to advanced cross-modal analysis. This example shows how to configure it with a specific embedding model and index type.

```python
from maif.semantic import SemanticEngine

# Initialize the Semantic Engine with configurations for embedding and search.
semantic = SemanticEngine(
    # Specify the pre-trained model to use for generating embeddings.
    embedding_model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
    # Choose the index type for vector search. HNSW is a high-performance index for large datasets.
    index_type="HNSW",
    # Enable cross-modal processing to find relationships between different data types.
    cross_modal_enabled=True
)
```

#### Streaming Engine

The Streaming Engine is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency data ingestion and retrieval. This example shows how to configure its buffering and compression settings.

```python
from maif.streaming import StreamingEngine

# Initialize the Streaming Engine with performance-tuning parameters.
streaming = StreamingEngine(
    # Set the buffer size for write operations. Larger buffers can improve throughput.
    buffer_size=128*1024, # 128 KB
    # Specify the compression algorithm. HSC is MAIF's novel semantic compression algorithm.
    compression_algorithm="HSC",
    # Enable memory-mapped I/O for zero-copy reads and faster access.
    memory_mapping=True
)
```

## Data Flow Architecture

Understanding how data flows through MAIF helps optimize performance and understand security boundaries:

    Storage->>Storage: Update semantic index
    Storage-->>Engine: Confirm storage
    
    Engine-->>SDK: Return block ID
    SDK-->>App: Return operation result
```

## Block Architecture

MAIF uses a sophisticated block system for data storage and management:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Block Structure"
        Block[MAIF Block]
        Header[Block Header]
        Metadata[Metadata Section]
        Data[Data Section]
        Signature[Signature Section]
        
        Block --> Header
        Block --> Metadata
        Block --> Data
        Block --> Signature
        
        Header --> H1[Block Type]
        Header --> H2[Version]
        Header --> H3[Size]
        Header --> H4[Checksum]
        
        Metadata --> M1[Timestamp]
        Metadata --> M2[Source]
        Metadata --> M3[Relationships]
        Metadata --> M4[Privacy Level]
        
        Data --> D1[Encrypted Payload]
        Data --> D2[Compression Info]
        Data --> D3[Embeddings]
        
        Signature --> S1[Digital Signature]
        Signature --> S2[Certificate Chain]
    end
    
    style Block fill:#3c82f6,stroke:#1e40af,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style Data fill:#10b981,stroke:#059669,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style Signature fill:#ef4444,stroke:#dc2626,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

### Block Types

1. **TextBlock**: Natural language content
2. **ImageBlock**: Image data with metadata
3. **EmbeddingBlock**: Vector embeddings
4. **StructuredDataBlock**: JSON/structured data
5. **AudioBlock**: Audio content
6. **VideoBlock**: Video content
7. **MetadataBlock**: System metadata

Each block type can be created with specialized options that trigger different processing pipelines.

```python
# Each block type supports specific features and metadata.

# Create a TextBlock with language detection and sentiment analysis enabled.
text_block = artifact.add_text("Hello", 
    language="en",
    sentiment_analysis=True
)

# Create an ImageBlock and request additional processing like feature extraction and captioning.
image_block = artifact.add_image(image_data,
    format="PNG",
    extract_features=True, # Extract features like objects and faces.
    generate_caption=True # Automatically generate a descriptive caption.
)

# Create an EmbeddingBlock with specific details about the embedding model.
embedding_block = artifact.add_embedding(vector,
    model="bert-base", # The model used to generate the embedding.
    dimension=768,     # The dimensionality of the vector.
    normalize=True     # Normalize the embedding vector to unit length.
)
```

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers with defense-in-depth principles:

MAIF is designed to leverage multi-core processors for parallel operations. This example shows how to configure the client for high concurrency.

```python
# Configure the MAIF client for parallel processing to maximize throughput.
client = create_client(
    "high-performance-agent",
    # Set the number of concurrent writers to allow parallel write operations.
    max_concurrent_writers=8,
    # Set the number of concurrent readers to allow parallel read operations.
    max_concurrent_readers=16,
    # Define the total size of the internal thread pool for worker tasks.
    thread_pool_size=32,
    # Enable asynchronous operations for non-blocking calls.
    enable_async=True
)
```

    key_derivation_rounds=200000,
    require_signatures=True,
    enable_hsm=True
)
```

### 3. Scalability Planning

```python
# Design for scale
client = create_client(
    "scalable-agent",
    enable_clustering=True,
    shard_strategy="consistent_hash",
    replication_factor=3,
    enable_load_balancing=True
)
