## Installation Methods

### 1. Basic Installation

For most users, the basic installation provides core MAIF functionality. This command installs the core `maif` package.

```bash
pip install maif
```

This includes:
- Core MAIF SDK
- Basic encryption and security
- Standard semantic embeddings
- File-based artifact storage

### 2. Full Installation (Recommended)

For production use and advanced features, install with the `[full]` extra. This command installs all optional dependencies for a feature-complete deployment.

```bash
pip install maif[full]
```

This includes everything from basic installation plus:
- Novel AI algorithms (ACAM, HSC, CSB)
- Advanced privacy features
- High-performance optimizations
- Distributed processing capabilities
- Enterprise security features

### 3. Development Installation

For contributors who need to set up a local development environment. These commands clone the repository and install the package in editable mode with all development dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maif-ai/maif.git
cd maif

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .[dev,full]

# Run tests to verify installation
pytest tests/
```

### 4. Docker Installation

For containerized deployments, use the official Docker image. These commands pull the latest image and run it with a volume for persistent data storage.

```bash
# Pull the official image
docker pull maif/maif:latest

# Run with volume mounting
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data maif/maif:latest
```

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

These commands update your system, install Python, create a virtual environment, and install MAIF.

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-pip python3.11-venv -y

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv maif-env
source maif-env/bin/activate

# Install MAIF
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maif[full]
```

### Linux (CentOS/RHEL)

These commands install Python, create a virtual environment, and install MAIF on CentOS or RHEL.

```bash
# Install Python 3.11
sudo dnf install python3.11 python3.11-pip -y

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv maif-env
source maif-env/bin/activate

# Install MAIF
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maif[full]
```

### macOS

These commands use Homebrew to install Python, then create a virtual environment and install MAIF.

```bash
# Install Python via Homebrew (recommended)
brew install python@3.11

# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv maif-env
source maif-env/bin/activate

# Install MAIF
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maif[full]
```

### Windows

These PowerShell commands create a virtual environment and install MAIF on Windows.

```powershell
# Install Python from python.org or Microsoft Store
# Then open PowerShell as Administrator

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv maif-env
.\maif-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install MAIF
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install maif[full]
```

## Optional Dependencies

```

Includes:
- Intel MKL optimizations
- CUDA support for GPU acceleration
- Distributed computing libraries

### Cloud Integrations

Install these dependencies to enable integration with major cloud storage providers.

```bash
pip install maif[cloud]
```

Includes:
- AWS S3 integration
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- Kubernetes operators

### Enterprise Features

Install these dependencies for enterprise-grade features like SSO and advanced compliance tooling.

```bash
pip install maif[enterprise]
```

Includes:
- Advanced audit logging

- Hardware security module (HSM) support
- Compliance reporting tools

## Verification

After installation, run this Python script to verify that MAIF is working correctly.

```python
import maif
from maif_sdk import create_client, create_artifact

# 1. Check the installed version of MAIF.
print(f"MAIF version: {maif.__version__}")

# 2. Test basic client and artifact creation.
# This ensures the core SDK is functioning.
client = create_client("test-agent")
artifact = create_artifact("test-artifact", client)

# 3. Add some test data to the artifact.
text_id = artifact.add_text("Hello, MAIF!")
print(f"âœ… Successfully created artifact with ID: {text_id}")

# 4. Test the encryption functionality.
# This adds a block of text that will be encrypted at rest.
encrypted_id = artifact.add_text("Secret data", encrypt=True)
print(f"âœ… Successfully encrypted data with ID: {encrypted_id}")

# 5. Test the semantic search capability.
# This verifies that the embedding models are working.
results = artifact.search("Hello", top_k=1)
print(f"âœ… Semantic search returned {len(results)} results")

print("ðŸŽ‰ MAIF installation verified successfully!")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Permission Errors

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
pip install --user maif[full]

# Or use virtual environment
python -m venv maif-env
source maif-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .\maif-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
pip install maif[full]
```

#### 2. Compilation Errors

Some dependencies require compilation. Install build tools:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo dnf install python3-devel

# macOS
xcode-select --install

# Windows
# Install Visual Studio Build Tools
```

#### 3. Memory Issues

For systems with limited memory:

```bash
# Install with reduced memory usage
pip install --no-cache-dir maif[full]

# Or install basic version first
pip install maif
```

#### 4. Network Issues

If you're behind a corporate firewall:

```bash
# Use corporate proxy
pip install --proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080 maif[full]

# Or download and install offline
pip download maif[full]
pip install --no-index --find-links . maif[full]
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Enable Memory Mapping

```python
from maif_sdk import create_client

client = create_client(
    "optimized-agent",
    enable_mmap=True,
    buffer_size=128*1024  # 128KB buffer
)
```

#### 2. Configure Parallel Processing

```python
client = create_client(
    "parallel-agent",
    max_concurrent_writers=8,
    enable_compression=True
)
```

#### 3. GPU Acceleration

```python
from maif.semantic import SemanticEmbedder

embedder = SemanticEmbedder(
    device="cuda",  # Use GPU if available
    batch_size=32   # Optimize batch size
)
```
